# digital-twin-azure-windturbine
This study evaluates the Microsoft Azure Digital Twins (ADT) platform for its feasibility in developing a digital twin of a wind turbine. Alongside a theoretical review of existing research, a prototype digital shadow of the AN Bonus 1000/54 wind turbine is implemented. The study focuses on integrating IoT data streams, calculating blade pitch angles, and visualizing system behavior through the ADT Explorer. The research methodology involves literature analysis, system architecture modeling, and data interpolation. The findings highlight the ADT platform’s capabilities for simulation and optimization of physical systems. However, constraints such as limited access to real-time performance data pose challenges to the creation of a full-fledged digital twin. Lastly, the study critically examines the platform’s cost efficiency.
